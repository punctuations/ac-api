## Introduction

[ac](https://ac.vercel.app/) is a website that plays Animal Crossing Music depending on the time and weather, this repository is an API for that.

This API is the official API for the site, all of the data returned is taken all from the source.

## Getting started

You can access the API endpoint by going to [ac-api.vercel.app](https://ac-api.vercel.app/) which will return a big ol' JSON response, then you can parse that.

If you're looking for a specific time and/or weather you can read more about queries in the [docs](https://ac-api.vercel.app/docs/queries/).
